- The time it took you to perform the exercise

I was a bit flexible with my time managing but I think, cutting off distractions and stops, I spent roughly the 5 hours.

- The parts that were difficult for you and why

None specially but I could say that I had to figure out a bit to work with ProBuilder (it was new to me but I thought that fit for building the blockout of levels), also spent some extra time with making trap physics and player work properly together (one of this things to me that you have to check out all the time in docs).

- The parts you think you could do better and how

I think the code and scene set up is good enough even for scaling up the game project, but still not too many things into it so not hard to happen this.
If you ask for personal suff, I know I'm not the fastest guy developing out there, it's something I work on daily to improve, I usually overthink stuff. I had would liked add one more trap type, enhance the visuals and also add UI for wrapping up game loop.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

  - Well what I said before, add more trap types, set a visual mood and add UI to start, end and retry. 
  - Obviously this game is much better with multiplayer so you need to pick a backend stack before you structure code.
  - Cameras need to be more flexible so can follow the player in more different ways that currently exit.
  - Make easier and more flexible for the level designer to set up a new level or modify existent, for example the way the spline that players follow to go through the level's track is set up, right now is something a bit clunky to work with.
  
- What did you think

I like it the test, it's pretty straightforward and not too much time consuming which I appreciate. I love the idea of prototyping games and I think it's a craft on its self. There is a video that comes to my mind on this topic which is from Gameloft studios https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU29QKag8a0

- Any comment you may have

I'm grateful for being able to make the test and have a chat with you. I wish to go further in the hiring process. Some final words, I consider myself a creative programmer, I love to think around the design and background of games I work on, I think I can give much valuable ideas (probably this comes from the fact that I have a wide range of different interests and I'm a avid consumer of good stuff) and at the same time I love low-level programming.

Thanks!
